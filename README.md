# flopy-tutorials
These notebooks were originally developed for teaching MODFLOW groundwater modeling through flopy and python at the Illinois State Water Survey. There are three examples numbered in order of increasing complexity that demonstrate the set-up and execution of seady-state and transient groundwater models in MODFLOW through the python package 'Flopy'.  This code was forked from [Shelby Ahrendt's flopy-tutorials repo](https://github.com/shelbyahrendt/flopy-tutorials) and updated to run in MODFLOW6.
