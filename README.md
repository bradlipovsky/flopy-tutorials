# flopy-tutorials
These IPython notebooks were developed for teaching MODFLOW groundwater modeling through flopy and python at the Illinois State Water Survey. There are three examples numbered in order of increasing complexity that demonstrate the set-up and execution of seady-state and transient groundwater models in MODFLOW through the python package 'Flopy'.
